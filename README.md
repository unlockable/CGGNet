# CGGNet


Compiler Guided Generation Network (CGGNet)

Currently, I am working on cleaning up the code. It will be updated as soon as possible

==============================================================

I am currently in the process of cleaning up the relevant code. However, due to personal issues and environmental constraints, I am unable to update it immediately. I apologize for this delay and appreciate your understanding.
For now, I am attaching the source code that can be used in the paper.
You can obtain results by running run_seqgan.py (although it's currently named seqGAN, it's actually CGGNet, a modified version of SeqGAN - it's not SeqGAN!). At present, there are numerous unnecessary dependency files and code segments.
We plan to modify these relevant parts as quickly as possible.
